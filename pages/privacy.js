              You can contact our data protection officer at the above address
              and at datenschutz@softgames.de.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have taken technical and organizational measures to ensure the
              security of your personal data. For example, we use the Transport
              Layer Security (TLS) for the transmission of data for encryption.
            </p>
            <h3>Please note:</h3>
            <p>
              You are not obliged by law to provide us with the personal data
              stated in this Privacy Notice. Specifically, the contractual
              relationship that you have entered into with us by agreeing to our
              terms and conditions (https://www.softgames.de/privacy-terms/)
              does not imply any obligation to provide your personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the transmission of the contract information provided by
              you to us is a basic requirement for the conclusion of a contract
              with us. In addition, you may not use the Website and/or the
              Gaming Applications or only to a limited extent if you do not
              provide us with certain data or object to the use of this data.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Which personal data we process and from which sources:</h3>
            <p>
              When we make our Website and/or the Gaming Applications available
              to you, we process personal data from various sources. On the one
              hand, these are data that we automatically process for every
              visitor when the Website and/or the Gaming Applications are
              accessed. However, this may also be data that you have voluntarily
              provided to us or that we receive from the partner websites.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Data that we automatically collect when you use our Website:
            </h4>
            <p>
              As soon as you visit the Website and/or the Gaming Application,
              you send technical information to our web servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This happens regardless of whether you register with an account to
              use the Website and/or the Gaming Applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In any case, we collect the following access and web access data
              (which we call “Usage Data”):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Date and time of the visit and the duration of the use of the
                Website and/or the Gaming Applications;
              </li>
              <li>The anonymized IP address of your device;</li>
              <li>
                the referral URL (the website from which you may have been
                referred);
              </li>
              <li>
                the visited sub-pages of the Website, including the Gaming
                Applications;
              </li>
              <li>
                and more information about your device (device type, browser
                type and version, settings, operating system).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We process the Usage Data in order to enable you to use the
              Website (including the Gaming Applications) and to ensure the
              functionality of the Website and/or the Gaming Applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we process the Usage Data to analyze the performance
              of the Website, continuously improve the Website and correct
              errors or personalize the content on the Website for you. However,
              we also process Usage Data in order to guarantee IT security and
              the operation of our systems and to prevent or detect misuse, in
              particular fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
              We store this Usage Data exclusively in anonymous form, so that it
              is no longer possible to draw any conclusions about your person.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use cookies for automatic processing of Usage Data. Cookies are
              small text files that you load onto your device when you visit our
              Websites and store the above information about yourself. We use
              our own cookies, but we also use cookies and tracking tools from
              third parties such as advertisement networks, Google and Facebook.
            </p>

              cookies process which data on our Website (including the Gaming

            <p>
              From our Partner Websites on which we roll out our Gaming
              Applications we receive information whether a user is a subscriber
              on such Partner Website or not.
            </p>
            <h4>Data that you yourself transmit to us:</h4>
            <p>
              In addition to the data we receive from all visitors, we also
              process other data. The exact amount of this data depends on how
              you use the Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Partners of us who register as Partner Website providers have to
              enter the following information to open a user account:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>your name</li>
              <li>Your e-mail address</li>
              <li>The Partner Website country</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Or you register with Google Sign-In as described in the third
              party policy here
              [https://www.softgames.de/cookie-3rd-party-information/].
            </p>
            <p>
              The data entered during registration will be used for the purpose
              of providing the Website and for notification by e-mail of any
              information relevant to the Website or registration, such as
              changes in the scope of the Website or technical circumstances and
              the implementation of the partner agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you contact Customer Service at info@softgames.de , the written
              communication between you and service staff and notes on each
              transaction will be stored until it is completed in order to
              ensure smooth customer service at all times when the transaction
              is resumed by other service staff.
            </p>
            <h3>2. The purposes for which we also process your data:</h3>
            <p>
              We have already informed you above for which purposes we process
              your data in individual cases. In addition, we may process your
              data for further purposes. This includes, for example, the
              disclosure of your personal data to third parties if we are
              legally obliged to do so, but also the assertion of legal claims
              on our part or the defence against legal disputes.
            </p>
            <h3>3. The legal basis for processing:</h3>
            <p>
              When processing your personal data, we rely on various legal bases
              in accordance with the so-called General Data Protection
              Regulation, an EU-wide legal framework for standardising data
              protection laws (“GDPR”). These are in detail:
            </p>
            <h4>Your consent (Article 6 (1) a) GDPR):</h4>
            <p>
              By registering or making a booking with your account details, you
              expressly agree to the data processing described in detail in this
              Privacy Notice by ticking the box before sending the registration
              or booking form: If we process your data within the framework of
              booking or providing your user account, it is therefore because
              you have consented to this. Your consent is therefore the most
              important legal basis for the processing of your personal data by
              us.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Fulfilment of our contractual obligations towards you (Article 6
              (1) b) GDPR):
            </h4>
            <p>
              At the same time, your data will also be processed for the
              provision of the Website as part of the fulfilment of our contract
              with you. Accordingly, in most cases the processing is not only
              justified by your consent, but also because it is necessary to
              fulfil our contractual obligations towards you.
            </p>
            <h4>Our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) f) GDPR):</h4>
            <p>
              There are also cases in which we would be entitled to process your
              data without your consent because it is necessary to protect our
              legitimate interests (or the interests of third parties). In this
              respect, the purposes described above, for which we process your
              data, also represent legitimate interests in many cases. This
              means that we may process the data necessary to guarantee the
              security of our IT systems in any case, even if you have not given
              or withdrawn your consent to this processing. This also concerns
              the prevention of abuse of our Website or the personalisation and
              targeting of advertisements to your interests (so-called direct
              marketing) in connection with the use of the Website, including
              the Gaming Applications.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Legal requirements (Article 6 (1) c) GDPR) or in the public
              interest (Article 6 (1) e) GDPR):
            </h4>
            <p>
              In addition, we are legally obliged to process certain data in
              individual cases in order to provide information to law
              enforcement authorities or tax authorities.
            </p>
            <h3>4. With whom we share your information:</h3>
            <p>
              With the exception of the service providers and partners described
              below, we will not pass on your data to third parties. Insofar as
              the respective listed recipients of the data receive data, these
              recipients will process your data solely on our instructions and
              have undertaken to comply with strict requirements for the
              security of your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, we transmit data to our hosting service providers
              that enable us to provide the Website. The providers listed in our
              information on cookies and tracking tools will only receive your
              pseudonymized data as further explained there
              [https://www.softgames.de/cookie-3rd-party-information/].
            </p>
            <h3>5. Data processing outside the EEA:</h3>
            <p>
              We do not transfer your access and account data to countries
              outside the EEA (so-called “third countries”). We do not host your
              data in third countries and all your data is located on the
              servers of our hosting service providers in the EU through Amazon
              Web Services Inc. 410 Terry Ave North Seattle, WA 98109-5210.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, however, your data will be processed in third
              countries. This applies in particular to third party cookies
              provided by companies based in the United States. However, we will
              ensure that an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed at
              all times.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ensure that data recipients are either certified according to
              the so-called “EU Privacy Shield” (as with Google and Facebook) or
              that the so-called EU standard contract clauses are included in
              our contracts with these providers in order to guarantee the
              security of processing and an appropriate level of data protection
              (as in the case of Amazon Web Services).
            </p>
            <h3>6. Data retention periods:</h3>
            <p>
              We process and store your personal data insofar as this is
              necessary to fulfil our contractual or legal obligations.
              Therefore, we store the data for as long as our contractual
              relationship with you exists and after termination only to the
              extent and for as long as required by the law of the Federal
              Republic of Germany. All other data will be deleted when you log
              out of the Website or are no longer needed to complete a booking.
              If the remaining data is no longer required to fulfil legal
              obligations (e.g. in accordance with tax or commercial law) after
              your deregistration or the closing of your booking (insofar as
              this took place without creating a user account), it will be
              regularly deleted, unless further processing is necessary to
              preserve evidence or to defend against legal claims against us.
              For the preservation of evidence, for example, your IP address and
              the exact time of issue are required if you have given us your
              consent (e.g. to receive the newsletter).
            </p>
            <h3>7. Your legal rights under the GDPR:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can assert the following rights against us within the scope
                of the GDPR with regard to your personal data:
              </li>
              <li>
                Your right to information and access in accordance with Article
                15 of the GDPR,
              </li>
              <li>Your right to rectification under Article 16 GDPR,</li>
              <li>Your right to erasure under Article 17 GDPR,</li>
              <li>
                Your right to limitation of processing under Article 18 GDPR and
              </li>
              <li>Your right to data portability under Article 20 GDPR.</li>
              <li>
                You also have a right of appeal to the competent data protection
                supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR in conjunction with § 19
                BDSG).
              </li>
              <li>
                You can also withdraw your consent to the processing of your
                personal data at any time. This also applies to the revocation
                of declarations of consent that we received before the GDPR
                became valid, i.e. before 25 May 2018. However, this revocation
                only applies to the future. Any processing that took place
                before the revocation remains unaffected by this.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
              Information on your right of objection under Article 21 GDPR
            </h4>
            <p>right of objection in individual cases</p>
            <p>
              In addition to the rights already mentioned, you have the right,
              for reasons arising from your particular situation, to object at
              any time to the processing of your personal data based on Article
              6 para. 1 e GDPR (data processing in the public interest) and
              Article 6 para. 1 f GDPR (data processing on the basis of a
              balance of interests). If you file an objection, we will no longer
              process your personal data unless we can prove compelling grounds
              for processing that outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms,
              or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal
              claims.
            </p>
            <p>
              the right to object to the processing of data for advertising
              purposes
            </p>
            <p>
              You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of
              your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing (including
              the subscription to our newsletter); this also applies to the
              creation of a user profile (so-called “profiling”), insofar as
              this is associated with direct marketing. If you file an
